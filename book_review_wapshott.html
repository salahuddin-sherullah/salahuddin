<p style="font-size: 12pt">The Clash That Defined Modern Economics by Wapshott is an account of one of the most important debates in modern economics. The Great Depression of the 1930s triggered a crucial discussion among economists to explain the roots and remedies of the business cycle. On the forefront of this economic debate were John Maynard Keynes and Friedrich August von Hayek. The confrontation between the two, which has been skillfully documented by Wapshott, led to some of the most important developments in modern economic thinking. At the center of this debate was the role of government and individual liberties in the market. Keynes advocated government spending to boost economy during recessions, and his main concern was to deal with mass unemployment that followed. He advocated public spending to increase the aggregate demand in the economy. His central idea was that public spending would help reduce unemployment and increase consumer spending, which in turn would boost the economy. Hayek, on the other hand, supported a free market where the government played a limited role and where most services, such as education and transportation, were privatized. He believed that markets are highly organic and, therefore, they should be allowed to function on their own. Focusing mostly on the Austrian theory of business cycles, Hayek believed in the efficiency of free markets driven by a price system. His main concern was that if the government attempts to boost economy by artificially pumping money into the markets then that would lead to uncontrolled inflation. Through his ideas, he established himself as a ‘libertarian’ and free market ideologue.</p>
<p style="font-size: 12pt">As Wapshott points out in his book, Keynes and Hayek disagreed greatly during the 1930s and triggered a heated debate concerning peaks and troughs of the business cycle. At one point, Keynes stopped responding to Hayek’s criticism and instead focused on refining his theories. After the Great Depression and the two World Wars, Keynes concerned himself with the “application of economics as a means of improving the lives of others”. Hayek distanced himself from politics and was mostly consumed by economic theory for its own sake. While Keynes remained a well renowned figure throughout his career, Hayek’s prominence came after he was awarded the Nobel Prize in Economic Sciences in 1974. Keynes had cemented his position in the economic world with the publication of his book ‘The General Theory’, which became the basis for many modern economic concepts including the distinction between micro and macroeconomics. Hayek, on the other hand, published his book ‘The Road to Serfdom’ in 1944 in which he gave stark warnings about the dangers of government control and central economic planning.</p>
    <p style="font-size: 12pt">Wapshott has given an excellent overview of the crucial debate in contemporary economics by using a lot of primary sources of information. His use of language is reasonable and it’s easy to see where Keynes and Hayek disagreed and what their main arguments were. He has also mentioned some of the more practical implications of the divide between the advocates of free markets and those who support government intervention. He has, more or less, focused equally on both Keynes and Hayek. He points out some of the important questions raised by the disagreement between the two economists including the role of investments and savings during booms and busts. He has skillfully traced the debate starting in 1927 and has documented the implications of both Keynes and Hayek on the broader economy. Up until 1970s, Keynesianism was the dominant economic theory employed by successive US administrations. Then came the push for free markets and minimum governmental control on the economy. The market system, however, was never allowed to be truly free as some sort of government control was deemed necessary. The assumption that free markets will correct themselves over time after a recession was never put to test. For example, Wapshott points out that when the 2008 financial crisis happened, the US decided to implement Keynesian thinking and, instead of allowing the market to recover itself, the government intervened and bailed out big firms to artificially stabilize the economy.</p>
    <p style="font-size: 12pt">Overall, the book is well constructed and does a good job in highlighting the relevance of the debate between Keynes and Hayek in the 21st century. However, sometimes it’s difficult to follow certain concepts such as ‘forced savings’. Wapshott’s emphasis on certain ideas such as aggregate demand seems to be repetitive. Also, it seems like he hasn’t given enough credit to Hayek and has depicted him as a man not concerned with human welfare but with the natural workings of the economy. Hayek is depicted as a man who has embarked on a journey to build a utopian world where free markets do their magic. For the most part, it feels like Hayek is against public spending entirely. Only in the last chapter does Wapshott mention that Hayek “advocated mandatory universal healthcare and unemployment insurance”. Keynes has been portrayed as more of a practical man concerned with the actual workings of the economy and ground realities. At one point Wapshott writes that Keynes, “rather than burying himself in abstruse theories channeled his energies toward practical remedies”. From the very beginning of the book, Keynes is concerned with the alleviation of human suffering and the moral responsibility of governments to provide employment opportunities for the unemployed. Wapshot gives too much credit to Keynesian theories for the economic prosperity during 1950s and 60s. The Keynesian remedies eventually led to ‘stagflation’, high inflation coupled with high unemployment, that was previously considered impossible. While the period from 1980 till 2008 is considered to be the period of liberalization and free economy, Wapshott does not do a good job in explaining the liberal market policies that were pursued during this time. While he credits the age of Keynesianism with “unrivaled prosperity”, he sees the period from 1980 to 2008 as a lesson learned from allowing the markets to function freely. However, in the end, Wapshott does not provide an answer as to who was right. He seems to be leaning more towards Keynes but admits that “it was hardly a decisive victory”. As Hayek’s biographer Robert Skidelsky pointed out; while Keynes won the debates of the 1930s, Hayek was eventually able to prove his point.</p>
