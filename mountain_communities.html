    <h3 style="text-align:center">Vulnerability of Mountain Communities to Climate Change in Gilgit-Baltistan</h3>
    <p style="text-align:center">March, 2019</p>
    <h4 style="text-align:left">Summary</h4>
    <p>Gilgit-Baltistan in Northern Pakistan has one of the highest concentration of mountains in the world and is home to the worldâ€™s second highest mountain, K2. Most of these mountains are part of the Karakoram mountain range which extends from Tajikistan to China. The Karakoram mountain range itself is connected to the Greater Himalayas which has a highly heterogeneous geography and is closely related to other mountain ranges in the region. During the last several decades, there has been a reduction in the volume of glaciers within the Karakoram range that has affected water availability and livelihoods of communities in the region. Although, there have been a number of glacier surges since the late 1990s, a phenomenon known as the Karakoram anomaly, they are regionally distinctive in nature and pose significant hazards to the people downstream. There are several small communities that live in valleys between mountains and depend heavily on local agricultural production for subsistence. The water, transported through a web of canals, comes from melting glaciers during summers and snow during winters. Since, the valleys are low areas located between hills and mountains, they are highly vulnerable to floods and landslides. There were widespread floods during 2010 due to an atypical monsoon season that impacted the livelihoods of hundreds of thousands in the Gilgit-Baltistan region. The rural economy in this part of Pakistan is highly dependent upon agriculture and tourism which are both under pressure from increasing global temperatures. Shifting atmospheric conditions and temperatures have impacted the biodiversity in the region and has endangered certain species such as snow leopards that are considered to play a significant role in indicating the health of their high-altitude habitat. This paper will focus on the impacts of climate change on this highly diverse and sensitive region to inquire how the changing global temperatures have affected water availability, vulnerability, and livelihoods of mountain communities living in the Gilgit-Baltistan region of the Karakoram.</p>
