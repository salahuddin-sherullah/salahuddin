                <p style="color: black">Hi, I am Salahuddin. Welcome to my online home. Here you will get to know about me and the work I do as a development sector practitioner and a data analyst. I started building this site in 2021 as a modest project to showcase my work
                    and hopefully start writing on a regular basis. Though I strive to keep it up-to-date, there might be occasional gaps between new posts. Primarily, this space caters to my own interests, making it a personal haven with the occasional
                    curious alien visitors. I have redesigned this site multiple times to match my personality. Going forward, I aim to keep this minimal and focus more on adding content. I am also adding a new section where I will share resources for
                    data science along with my portfolio notebooks.</p>
