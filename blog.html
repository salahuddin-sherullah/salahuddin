					<h3 style="text-align:center">Countering China in Southeast Asia and Beyond</h3>
                    <p style="text-align:center"> Oct 3, 2019</p>
					<p> When China emerged as a world economic and military power, it took many countries by surprise. While at one point it was considered a far-fetched perception that China will take the center-stage in global politics and economics, it is no longer intelligent to ignore China's global influence. With its ambitious Belt and Road Initiative, and the emergence of technology giants such as Tencent and Alibaba, China has both the will and the power to challenge the United States. As Trump continues to attack international institutions and take a step back from global leadership, China is willing to emerge as a champion of globalization and expand its sphere of influence by investing in infrastructure around the world. Taking advantage of shifting global geopolitics and Trump administration’s ‘America First’ policy, China has already established strong economic and military relations with countries in Southeast Asia. Its most iconic Belt and Road Initiative has attracted a lot of attention and has worried many developed countries. How the world should respond to this quickly growing Chinese influence remains an important question. </p>
<p>Today, China has an important role to play in global geopolitics and to maintain a balance of power in the world. However, China’s current ambitions threaten to disturb that balance of power, especially as the US retreats from globalism. The previous US administration under Obama made efforts to improve US commitments in Southeast Asia through “rebalance to Asia” strategy that involved “multilateral diplomacy, economic integration, and military presence”. The Obama administration also pursued the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) trade deal that was immediately dismantled by the Trump administration. Many Asian countries now worry that the US doesn’t have a clear strategic interest in Asia apart from containing China’s maritime presence in South China Sea.</p> 
<p>In such a scenario, China has emerged as a champion, especially for the developing countries that are receiving billions of dollars in funds to build infrastructure. This new Chinese state-led funding is a source of economic prosperity for many countries that could not have raised funds to finance these projects otherwise. Therefore, many countries are eager to receive Chinese funding as the offer is on the table for anyone willing to participate in China’s “project of the century”. Furthermore, there is a major infrastructure gap in the world that cannot be filled by the development banks and private investors alone. Chinese investment presents an alternative to these sources of funding. There is another catch, unlike the World Bank, Chinese funding doesn’t come with structural reform requirements and, therefore, it allows governments to make their own decisions about allocation of funds. However, it does require countries to use a lot of Chinese labor and machinery and most contracts are awarded to state-owned Chinese firms. Through its Belt and Road Initiative, China is essentially seeking to displace American hegemony in Asia and the US seems to be looking the other way. While most countries welcome this new Chinese investment, some countries such as India, are wary of taking Chinese funding. They see the Belt and Road Initiative as a political tool and a debt trap that will essentially allow China to control foreign governments by attaining a strategic hold over them. Public sentiments about Chinese investment have slightly changed over the last few years as countries have started to accumulate debt. Pakistan, for example, is implementing one of the biggest projects within the Belt and Road Initiative. Valued at $62 billion, the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor or CPEC, was established in 2013 and many projects are currently under construction. The debts have accumulated so much that one of the main challenges faced by the new Pakistani government under Imran Khan, is whether to go to IMF for a bailout. </p>
<p>As China continues to grow and strive for global dominance, the world can no longer look the other way and ignore China as a petty economy. Economically and militarily strong Asian countries such as Japan and India should work together to create a balance of power in Asia. Many countries have lost faith in the US leadership and are looking to either China or to each other for support. Asia is currently not high up in the list of Trump administration’s priorities. Therefore, strong Asian countries need to work together in a way as to maximize the benefits from Chinese investment and minimize the risks. To the extent that the Belt and Road Initiative is encouraging infrastructure building, it should be welcomed, as it could benefit the whole world. However, the dangers associated with the project, such as rising of debt to unsustainable levels, should be mitigated. While it is essential at the moment that US keep the status as the global leader, countries need to realize that they cannot always rely on the US leadership. The US should help in the whole process, however, countries should own the initiative to counter China.

								<h3>How to Negotiate with the Taliban</h3>
								<p>After 17 years of fighting in Afghanistan against the Taliban insurgents, the US doesn’t seem to be any close to winning the war through military means. In recent years, there has been a shift in Afghan strategy, and it has become increasingly clear that a long-term sustainable political solution in the country is only feasible through diplomacy and negotiations.</p>

								<h3>Book Review - Keynes Hayek: The Clash That Defined Modern Economics</h3>
								<p>The Clash That Defined Modern Economics by Wapshott is an account of one of the most important debates in modern economics. The Great Depression of the 1930s triggered a crucial discussion among economists to explain the roots and remedies of the business cycle.
