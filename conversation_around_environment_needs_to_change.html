    <h3 style="text-align:center">The Conversation around the Environment Needs to Change</h3>
    <p style="text-align:center"> Aug, 2021</p>
    <p> The policy prescriptions for the current global environmental issues are influenced by popular discourses and narratives. These discourses and narratives usually tend to present an oversimplified explanation to some of the most pressing issues. Such oversimplifications are an attempt to present a common language and understanding of environmental problems to devise global environmental policies that might not be appropriate for certain geographical regions. There is not a single explanation for environmental degradation problems and, therefore, a single solution cannot uniformly produce the same results. Ignoring other variables that might be contributing to the environmental harms, such as the local economy and social factors, will produce deficient and apolitical explanations. </p>
    <p>Much has been said about the structure and nature of such discourses that dominate our understanding of global environmental problems. By drawing parallels between global environmental management discourses and populist discourses, one can see how our understanding of environmental issues can drive very different policy fixes. The global environmental management discourse, for example, calls for external policy interventions and puts most of the blame on the locals for causing environmental degradation. Such a discourse is supported by policies that focus on changing the behavior of the locals and ‘educating’ them about environmental concerns. </p>
    <p>The populist discourse, on the other hand, depicts external actors and interventions as the cause of environmental degradation and exploitation. These discourses will produce policies that focus on keeping a check on external actors such as industrialists. A closer look at some of the environmental issues, such as deforestation, desertification, biodiversity utilization, and climate change, reveals how these contrasting discourses drive our understanding and how they inform policymakers to formulate different policy instruments. There are also concerns about who produces and reproduces these discourses and if they sufficiently take into account the local realities. There often is a disconnect between popular environmental explanations and the complex local realities that such explanations tend to ignore.</p>
    <p>In the popular narrative, deforestation in the Gilgit-Baltistan region is blamed on human settlement and rapid population growth. The local communities are blamed for the widespread destruction of the forests through shifting cultivation and rapid construction. This narrative has been adopted by international organizations such as the World Bank to fund projects that aim to change the behavior of the local population towards more ‘sustainable’ alternatives. The World Bank tends to fund projects that support this narrative and focus on changing the mindsets and the activities of the natives. Although deforestation is a real issue, the explanations for its causes and policy fixes ignore ground realities and local context. For example, population growth has contributed to deforestation in many places, but in other places, it has contributed to afforestation and soil conservation. There are numerous examples within the Gilgit-Baltistan region where the population growth has contributed to plantations in previously barren areas. People with limited resources will look for ways to maximize their utility and will apply tools that make sense in the local context. Political explanations, therefore, present an incomplete picture of the problem and often exaggerate the issues that require a deeper understanding. A more balanced approach is possible, only if the policy-making institutions were not so distanced from the highly vulnerable local communities. </p>
